# hzz analysis

First navigate to hzz directory with:
```
$ cd hzz
```

## To run with bash script

Run:
```
$ ./hzz_bash.sh <number divisions>
```
The value for the number of divisions will dictate how many divisions the analysis can be split into for running. This is purely demonstrative in this case, as they will still be run sequentially, not saving any time.
